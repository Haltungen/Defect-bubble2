\title{Localized modes for acoustic waves in a bubbly crystal with a defect}

\section{Purpose and goals}
We consider acoustic waves propagation through a liquid with bubbles. These bubbles resonates at a frequency which correspond to wavelengths much larger than the bubble, the so called Minnaert resonance frequency. Specifically, we consider a periodic array of bubbles, where the size of one of the bubbles is perturbed. The goal is to analytically and numerically show that this crystal has a localized eigenmode close to the defect bubble.

It has previously been shown that an unperturbed, periodic bubble crystal has a bandgap close to the Minnaert resonance \cite{bandgap}. Physically, this means that waves with frequencies inside the bandgap will be exponentially decaying inside the crystal. Furthermore, it has been experimentally shown that a perturbed crystal will have a localized mode, i.e. for waves of certain frequencies inside the bandgap, the wave will be localized around the perturbation and will be exponentially decaying away from the perturbation \cite{experiment}.
